- Brought a powered USB hub from work to allow keyboard/mouse
  and USB wifi adapter to be used at same time.  Also using it
  to power the rpi.
- Got wireless adapter working:

- Installed fbtft drivers:
    https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki#install
- Wired ili9340 display:
  https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki/LCD-Modules#adafruit-22
  My display isn't the Adafruit one, but it appears to be compatible.
- Tried enabling display with
    sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruit22
  Didn't work: noticed in the dmesg output that reported resolution
  was wrong.  This driver is apparently for the old version of the 2.2"
  Adafruit display.

- Display is working!  Enabled with
    sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruit22a
  And it worked perfectly!  Ran X windows with
    FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1 startx
  and it ran!  Framerate seems pretty reasonable.
