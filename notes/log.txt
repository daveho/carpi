- Brought a powered USB hub from work to allow keyboard/mouse
  and USB wifi adapter to be used at same time.  Also using it
  to power the rpi.
- Got wireless adapter working:

- Installed fbtft drivers:
    https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki#install
- Wired ili9340 display:
  https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki/LCD-Modules#adafruit-22
  My display isn't the Adafruit one, but it appears to be compatible.
- Tried enabling display with
    sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruit22
  Didn't work: noticed in the dmesg output that reported resolution
  was wrong.  This driver is apparently for the old version of the 2.2"
  Adafruit display.

- Display is working!  Enabled with
    sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruit22a
  And it worked perfectly!  Ran X windows with
    FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1 startx
  and it ran!  Framerate seems pretty reasonable.
- Started enclosure design in LibreCad: plate.dxf is the outline of
  the top/bottom plates with (I think) correctly-sized holes for the
  6-32 screws that will secure the standoffs.
- Ordered board mounts from Adafruit - these are basically standoffs
  that have slots that fit the edge of a PC board.  The Rpi doesn't
  really have mounting holes as such, so these seem to be the best
  way to fasten the Rpi to the bottom plate.

- Ordered .25"x1" hex 6-32 F/F standoffs from Ebay.  (25 for $8 with free
  shipping!)  Plan is that 4 of these will connect the plates to each other.
  The Rpi will be attached to the bottom plate and the display and buttons
  will be attached to the top plate.
- Changed enclosure drawing to make plates 127mm x 77mm: this is 5"x3"
  (actually slightly more than 3").  This will leave some room for
  attaching the board mounts for the pi: 5"x2.5" (my original dimensions)
  would have the edges of the Rpi right at the edge of the plates
  in the long dimension, leaving no space for the board mounts.

- Redoing enclosure design to see if I can make it work with the
  top and bottom plates being 69mm (2.75") in the narrow dimension.
  This is to try to take advantage of the following laser
  cutting service:
    http://www.spikenzielabs.com/Catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=13&products_id=22
  $20 for arbitrary cuts on a 5.5"x5.5" sheet of 1/8" acrylic.
- Just found out that the CAD drawing (of the RPi outline) was
  a BOTTOM VIEW. Sigh.
- Found out that the official PCB dimensions are 85mm x 56.2mm.
  Also, according to
    http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/tag/mounting-holes
  the mounting hole locations are at x=25.5mm, y=18.0mm and
  x=80.1mm, y=43.6mm, relative to the bottom left corner.  Updated
  plate.dxf to reflect this.
- The mounting holes are meant to accept M2.5 screws.  Ordered from
  Ebay:
  - 25x 6mm nylon M2.5 M/F standoffs
  - 25x M2.5 nylon nuts
  - 50x M2.5 8mm screws
  The idea is that the female part of the standoff will be attached
  to the bottom plate with the 8mm screw, and that the PCB itself
  will be attached by fastening the nut to the male part of the
  standoff.  Since the standoffs and nuts are nylon, hopefully this will
  make it less likely to damage the PCB.  The acrylic will be
  1/8", which is 3.175mm.  This should mean that a bit less than
  4mm of the screw will be screwed into the female part of the standoff,
  which seems reasonable.
- The standoffs are 6mm, while the board mounts are .25", which is
  about 6.4mm.  I'm hoping that the .4mm won't make a big difference.
  If it is an issue, probably I can put a washer between the standoff
  and the plate to give it a bit of extra height.
