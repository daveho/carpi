- Brought a powered USB hub from work to allow keyboard/mouse
  and USB wifi adapter to be used at same time.  Also using it
  to power the rpi.
- Got wireless adapter working:

- Installed fbtft drivers:
    https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki#install
- Wired ili9340 display:
  https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki/LCD-Modules#adafruit-22
  My display isn't the Adafruit one, but it appears to be compatible.
- Tried enabling display with
    sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruit22
  Didn't work: noticed in the dmesg output that reported resolution
  was wrong.  This driver is apparently for the old version of the 2.2"
  Adafruit display.

- Display is working!  Enabled with
    sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruit22a
  And it worked perfectly!  Ran X windows with
    FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1 startx
  and it ran!  Framerate seems pretty reasonable.
- Started enclosure design in LibreCad: plate.dxf is the outline of
  the top/bottom plates with (I think) correctly-sized holes for the
  6-32 screws that will secure the standoffs.
- Ordered board mounts from Adafruit - these are basically standoffs
  that have slots that fit the edge of a PC board.  The Rpi doesn't
  really have mounting holes as such, so these seem to be the best
  way to fasten the Rpi to the bottom plate.

- Ordered .25"x1" hex 6-32 F/F standoffs from Ebay.  (25 for $8 with free
  shipping!)  Plan is that 4 of these will connect the plates to each other.
  The Rpi will be attached to the bottom plate and the display and buttons
  will be attached to the top plate.
- Changed enclosure drawing to make plates 127mm x 77mm: this is 5"x3"
  (actually slightly more than 3").  This will leave some room for
  attaching the board mounts for the pi: 5"x2.5" (my original dimensions)
  would have the edges of the Rpi right at the edge of the plates
  in the long dimension, leaving no space for the board mounts.

- Redoing enclosure design to see if I can make it work with the
  top and bottom plates being 69mm (2.75") in the narrow dimension.
  This is to try to take advantage of the following laser
  cutting service:
    http://www.spikenzielabs.com/Catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=13&products_id=22
  $20 for arbitrary cuts on a 5.5"x5.5" sheet of 1/8" acrylic.
- Just found out that the CAD drawing (of the RPi outline) was
  a BOTTOM VIEW. Sigh.
- Found out that the official PCB dimensions are 85mm x 56.2mm.
  Also, according to
    http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/tag/mounting-holes
  the mounting hole locations are at x=25.5mm, y=18.0mm and
  x=80.1mm, y=43.6mm, relative to the bottom left corner.  Updated
  plate.dxf to reflect this.
- The mounting holes are meant to accept M2.5 screws.  Ordered from
  Ebay:
  - 25x 6mm nylon M2.5 M/F standoffs
  - 25x M2.5 nylon nuts
  - 50x M2.5 8mm screws
  The idea is that the female part of the standoff will be attached
  to the bottom plate with the 8mm screw, and that the PCB itself
  will be attached by fastening the nut to the male part of the
  standoff.  Since the standoffs and nuts are nylon, hopefully this will
  make it less likely to damage the PCB (than metal fasteners would be).
  The acrylic will be 1/8", which is 3.175mm.  This should mean that
  a bit less than 4mm of the screw will be screwed into the female part
  of the standoff, which seems reasonable.
- The standoffs are 6mm, while the board mounts are .25", which is
  about 6.4mm.  I'm hoping that the .4mm won't make a big difference.
  If it is an issue, probably I can put a washer between the standoff
  and the plate to give it a bit of extra height.

- Did a CAD drawing of the LCD.  Added it to plate.dxf.  Discovered that
  the only way that both the LCD and buttons PCB will fit is if the
  the LCD is vertical.  The LCD fits quite nicely that way, and
  makes better use of the available space.
- Started a CAD drawing of the buttons PCB, and discovered that the
  5cm x 7cm protoboard I ordered previously will not fit, either
  horizontally or vertically.  Horizontally, 5cm is too wide to fit
  between the standoffs.  Vertically, 7cm would cause the PCB to stick
  out from the top plate on one or both sides.  Ordered some 4cm x 6cm
  protoboards from Ebay (from Colorado, they will probably arrive
  sooner than the 5x7 ones from China).
- Added a preliminary button PCB board outline and guess at screw hole
  locations and sizes to plate.dxf.  When the PCB and buttons arrive
  I will need to come up with some kind of accurate drawing.
  The 4cm x 6cm size does fit very nicely in a horizontal orientation.
  Probably only two rows of buttons will be possible, so maybe
  2 rows by 3 columns.  Should fit and hopefully also leave room for
  the debouncing circuit.
- Ordered some stuff from allelectronics.com:
  * caps and resistor networks for debounce circuit
  * 2x13 (26 pin) female IDC headers (for connecting to RPi
    GPIO header)
  * 5" 8x1 jumpers
  * 1.375" 6-32 F/F standoffs (in case the 1" ones don't leave enough
    room between the top and bottom plates)
- Had an idea for the wiring: could the wires from the 8x1 jumpers
  be crimped directly into the 2x13 IDC header, making connections to
  arbitrary pins?  That would hugely simplify the wiring: the LCD
  and button board could simply receive connections via a standard
  8x1 header (the LCD already has one, could easily solder one
  on the button PCB.)  8 pins is perfect for VCC, GND, and 1 signal
  for each of the 6 buttons.

Dec 24th, 2013 - Dec 31st, 2013

- Created initial version of software: using ncurses for the UI,
  but making the models/controllers completely independent of the views
  so ports to other UI toolkits will be possible.  Started by
  implementing a music player using mpg321 and ogg123 via the
  remote control interface as a back end.  Works fairly well for
  mp3 playback, ogg playback needs some work because ogg123 doesn't
  really implement the remote control interface fully.
- Pushed repo to github: https://github.com/daveho/carpi
- Ordered square pushbuttons from Adafruit: the ones I ordered from
  Ebay haven't arrived.  This is the problem with ordering parts
  from China: you don't know whether the parts will arrive in a
  timely manner (or at all).

Jan 1st, 2014

- Idea: use attiny2313 to debounce pushbuttons.  This should greatly
  simplify the pushbutton circuit (no resistors/caps needed).
  The datasheet says it can run from 3V, and this should allow
  signal compatibility with the RPi.
