- Brought a powered USB hub from work to allow keyboard/mouse
  and USB wifi adapter to be used at same time.  Also using it
  to power the rpi.
- Got wireless adapter working:

- Installed fbtft drivers:
    https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki#install
- Wired ili9340 display:
  https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki/LCD-Modules#adafruit-22
  My display isn't the Adafruit one, but it appears to be compatible.
- Tried enabling display with
    sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruit22
  Didn't work: noticed in the dmesg output that reported resolution
  was wrong.  This driver is apparently for the old version of the 2.2"
  Adafruit display.

- Display is working!  Enabled with
    sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruit22a
  And it worked perfectly!  Ran X windows with
    FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1 startx
  and it ran!  Framerate seems pretty reasonable.
- Started enclosure design in LibreCad: plate.dxf is the outline of
  the top/bottom plates with (I think) correctly-sized holes for the
  6-32 screws that will secure the standoffs.
- Ordered board mounts from Adafruit - these are basically standoffs
  that have slots that fit the edge of a PC board.  The Rpi doesn't
  really have mounting holes as such, so these seem to be the best
  way to fasten the Rpi to the bottom plate.

- Ordered .25"x1" hex 6-32 F/F standoffs from Ebay.  (25 for $8 with free
  shipping!)  Plan is that 4 of these will connect the plates to each other.
  The Rpi will be attached to the bottom plate and the display and buttons
  will be attached to the top plate.
- Changed enclosure drawing to make plates 127mm x 77mm: this is 5"x3"
  (actually slightly more than 3").  This will leave some room for
  attaching the board mounts for the pi: 5"x2.5" (my original dimensions)
  would have the edges of the Rpi right at the edge of the plates
  in the long dimension, leaving no space for the board mounts.
