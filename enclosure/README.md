The enclosure designs were created with LibreCAD.

Files:

* plate.dxf - the complete drawing showing locations/sizes of all features
  for both the bottom and top plates
* bottom.dxf, top.dxf - drawings of just the bottom and top plates (showing
  only screw holes and cuts)
* combined.dxf - combined drawing of top and bottom plates (just screw
  holes and cuts), with a 1"x1" reference square for accurate scale
* ibex\_rpi\_model\_b\_v1\_00.dxf - CAD drawing of the Raspberry Pi,
  taken from http://www.raspberry-projects.com/pi/pi-hardware/model-b-cad
* ibex\_rpi\_model\_b\_v1\_00\_correct\_orientation.dxf -
  same as above, but shown as a top view instead of a bottom view
* lcd.dxf - drawing of just the LCD module, showing screw hole locations
* buttons.dxf - drawing of just the button / LCD connector PCB,
  showing the screw hole locations,
  should match the .brd file in the buttons directory
